<hr />

This video is very good for any Frontend Developer who wants to invest in his skills in JavaScript. The idea of â€‹â€‹the video is that we will write code to modify the Notion website and make it support Arabic while it is open on our deviceâ€™s browser. In order to do this, we will explain one of the most powerful JavaScript APIs, which is the `MutationObserver`, and not only that, we will be able to save this code inside the browser via a chrome extension, so that we can use it whenever we want.

And for whom this video is not useful as they are not programmers, they can use the extension and copy/paste the code to make use of thisd feature.
